<p> My coding journey </p>
<p>


    Decide where you’ll publish your post
Medium, freeCodeCamp, dev.to, and your own site are only a few options
of places where you can publish your blog post.


^ Go to medium, then share your personal blog?


Can you commit to one blog post a month to start?

Free resources for creating a great blog post
• Grammarly, a free online editing tool that I use on all my posts
• A post from Seth Godin about building an audience
• I love using Unsplash, but there are a ton of places online where you
can find free images as long as you give the photographer credit.
• Canva, a free graphic design tool
• Google analytics to find out who is reading your blog posts
• Loom for great desktop recordings
• I’ve used Audacity for ages. It’s a free audio recorder and audio
editor.
• I use ConvertKit to build my email list. It’s easy and simple to use
